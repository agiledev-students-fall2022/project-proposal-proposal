# WhatToDoToday?

By: Bhavicka Mohta

### What and why?

In today's world, we often spend more time trying to decide on plans with our friends than on the plans themselves. Deciding what everyone is in the mood for is hard, and then sifting through tons of rating sites to find something you can agree on would just kill anyone's mood to go out. There are also just times when we want to go out and do something but don't know the places to go to, whether it be a place we have lived in our whole lives or a completely new city. On this website, you could enter the number of people you are going out with, a number of other parameters such as moods, budget and whether you are looking for just a place to eat or something to do (and obviously options where you are undecided) and return an activity to do that day. There could also be an option to go out with new people open to meeting up, for those who are bored of going out alone.

### For whom?

This website help anyone just looking to have a good time save a lot of time in the process of deciding.

### How?

First, you enter whether you already have a group to go with (can be alone) or want to be randomly matched up. Then the software takes in your details - as many as you want to give, and also asks you if you are open to meeting other people (if you are already having a group). In the case of already having a group, you will directly get the result for the place and if you are not completely sold on it, you could generate a new option until you lock on one. In the case of trying to be randomly matched up, it can show you people who are open to meeting up and what places they are planning to go to. There can also be a chat feature to coordinate details or decide to generate something new together.

### Scope

This project would require quite some time to determine a suitable matching software based on your preferences, and implementing other features such as chatting, possibly a map to the places and making a user-friendly design should be achievable in a semester.
